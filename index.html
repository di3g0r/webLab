         What is it?
       </h4>
       <p>
       Git is a fast, efficient, distributed version control system ideal for the collaborative development of software. <br><br>
   
   GitHub is the easiest (and prettiest) way to participate in that collaboration: fork projects, send pull requests, monitor development, all with ease.

           How does it work?
         </h4>
         <p>
         Get up and running in seconds by forking a project, pushing an existing repository, or starting fresh. No approval is necessary.<br><br>
   
   GitHub was written for public, open source projects and private, proprietary codes — if you use Git, GitHub is for you.
         </p>
         <h4>
           What else does it do?
         </h4>
         <p>
         GitHub provides pre-rolled post-commit hooks (IRC, Jabber, Email, Trac, Campfire, etc.) as well as an innovative web hook system for writing your own.<br><br>
   
   Every repository comes with SSH support for pushing and pulling. Private repositories enjoy full SSL support on the web side, as well.
